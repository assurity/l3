# Service Innovation Lab - Signboard

We were tasked to create a digital signboard for the Service Innovation Lab.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

You will need the following installed to make changes to the project. The assumption is that you are using a windows machine to make changes to the project.

You will need:

1. GitHub
